## Overview
This is my second Solo Project from Scrimba! The task was to get familiar with the Math Random method to create a two-password generator simultaneously using an array of all the characters. I have to be honest, it was extremely challenging for me. I was able to create the function to generate the paswords; however, adding options for the type of character nearly made me quit. I put a lot of time into this project and although I made it work with the knowledge I have now; I'm sure there is much advance approach to it.
